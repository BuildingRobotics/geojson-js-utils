h1. GeoJSON Utilities for JavaScript

Here you will find some simple utility functions to help you turn GeoJSON objects into a valid feature collection. 

This was written because I wanted to display arbitrary GeoJSON objects using OpenLayers, but an OpenLayers Strategy will only accept a FeatureCollection. I use these functions to turn my basic geometries (Point, MultiPoint, LineString, MultiLineString, Polygon, MultiPolygon) into valid FeatureCollections.

h2. Example

Here's an array of two GeoJSON Point objects:

<pre><code>
[{"coordinates" : [-122.672727,45.521561],"type" : "Point"}, 
 {"coordinates" : [-122.675647,45.523729],"type" : "Point"}]
</code></pre>

If you feed that through the @GeoJSONHelper.feature_collection_for@ function you will receive:

<pre><code>
{ "type" : "FeatureCollection",
  "features" : [{"geometry" : 
    { "type" : "GeometryCollection",
      "geometries" : [
        { "coordinates" : [-122.672727,45.521561], "type" : "Point" },
        { "coordinates" : [-122.675647,45.523729], "type" : "Point" }
      ]
    }}
  ]
}
</code></pre>
