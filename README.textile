h1. GeoJSON Utilities for JavaScript

Here you will find some simple utility functions to help you manipulate and work with GeoJSON objects.

Some algorithms adapted from "bjwbell/canvas-geolib":https://github.com/bjwbell/canvas-geolib

h2. Line intersections

<pre>
  <code>
    var g = require('geojson-utils.js').init()

    g.linesIntersect([[0,6],[6,6]], [[0,3],[6,3]])
    => false

    g.linesIntersect([[0,6],[6,6]], [[3,0],[3,9]])
    => [3,6]
  </code>
</pre>

h2. Point in polygon

<pre>
  <code>
    g.pointInPolygon([3,3], [[0,0],[0,6],[6,6],[6,0]])
    => true
    
    g.pointInPolygon([-1,-1], [[0,0],[0,6],[6,6],[6,0]])
    => false
  </code>
</pre>

h2. and much much more!
