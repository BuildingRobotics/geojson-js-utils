h1. GeoJSON Utilities for JavaScript

Here you will find some functions to help you manipulate and work with GeoJSON objects.

Some algorithms adapted from "bjwbell/canvas-geolib":https://github.com/bjwbell/canvas-geolib

h2. How to use!

Load up with your favorite "CommonJS module implementation":http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1:

<pre>
  <code>
    var g = require('geojson-utils.js').init();
  </pre>
</code>

Remember, GeoJSON coordinates are ordered [y,x] to comply with the Open Geospatial Consortium's recommendation!

h2. Line intersections

<pre>
  <code>
    g.linesIntersect({ "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [[0, 2], [5, 2]] },
                     { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [[3, 0], [3, 4], [4,4], [4,0]] })
    => [{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2,3]},{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2,4]}]

    g.linesIntersect({ "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [[0, 2], [5, 2]] },
                     { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [[0, 0], [5, 0]] })
    => false
  </code>
</pre>

h2. Point in polygon

<pre>
  <code>
    g.pointInPolygon({"type":"Point","coordinates":[3,3]}, 
                     {"type":"Polygon", "coordinates":[[[0,0],[6,0],[6,6],[0,6]]]})
    => [{"type":"Point","coordinates":[3,3]}]
    g.pointInPolygon({"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1,-1]}, 
                     {"type":"Polygon", "coordinates":[[[0,0],[6,0],[6,6],[0,6]]]})
    => false
  </code>
</pre>

h2. and much much more!
